I am a first-year Biostatistics PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania broadly interested in topics surrounding assumption-lean inference.

Some words that catch my attention are *causality*, *distributional shifts*,  *distribution free*, and *post-selection inference*. 


Before joining the PhD program, I obtained my BS in Statistics and Data Science from Carnegie Mellon University.
