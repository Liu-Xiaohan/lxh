I am a first-year Biostatistics PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania broadly interested in topics surrounding assumption-lean inference.

Some things that I am currently curious about are: *Causal inference* from observational data; Hypothesis testing under *distributional shifts*; *Distribution free* inference; Selective inference




Before joining the PhD program, I obtained my BS in Statistics and Data Science from Carnegie Mellon University.
