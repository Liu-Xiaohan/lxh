    "text": "I played flute in my middle school band, high school marching band, wind ensemble, full orchestra, TMEA Region Band, Orchestra, and All-State Band.\nAt CMU, I was lucky to continue playing as part of the All-University Orchestra.\nI primarily enjoy middle to late romantic, impressionist, and modern composers. Some of my favorites are Sibelius, The Mighty Five, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, and Vasily Kalinnikov’s symphonies. Recently, I have been consumed by Mahler’s epic symphonies (No. 2 and 3 are favorites!). Besides orchestral music, I enjoy listening to piano and Studio Ghibli soundtracks."

    "text": "My Fall 2024 rotation project revolved around the theme of information borrowing to achieve efficiency gains in inference in the clinical trials. We are interested in the setting of hybrid and externally controlled clinical trials where there is a small cohort of individuals enrolled in the trial but there exists a potentially large reference population of individuals who can serve as external controls.\nThere has been many studies on generalizing causal inferences from randomized trials to an external target population but not much work on methods of leveraging external control data to improve the efficiency of inference in clinical trials that omit making strong exchangeability assumptions about the trial and external populations.\nMore details to come in Spring and Summer 2025."

The texture is too watery for me but the flavor is nice, similar to a pear and pineapple\nEvercrisp - Texture is good but honestly too sweet and not much flavor\nCinnamon Spice - Wonderful, spciy flavor.\nJonagold - Sweet but well rounded flavor, very juicy, texture could be crunchier, reminiscent of Macintosh, flavor is really nice! (A tier)\nCrimson Topaz - Tart! Juicy, cider-y taste, very beautiful flesh, pink/salmon colored (S-tier)\nLudicrisp - very juicy, slightly tart but overall sweet, nice texture but could be harder (A-tier)\nCrimson crisp - nothing special, very good texture solid apple flavor"
