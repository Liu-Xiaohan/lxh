title: "Apples"

I have a slight obsession with apples. Here is a complete ranking of varieties I have tried. 

Pazazz - Very similar to Honeycrisp but much juicier. The texture is too watery for me but the flavor is nice, similar to a pear and pineapple 

Evercrisp - Texture is good but honestly too sweet and not much flavor 

Cinnamon Spice - Wonderful, spciy flavor.

Jonagold - Sweet but well rounded flavor, very juicy, texture could be crunchier, reminiscent of Macintosh, flavor is really nice! (A tier)

Crimson Topaz - Tart! Juicy, cider-y taste, very beautiful flesh, pink/salmon colored (S-tier) 

Ludicrisp - very juicy, slightly tart but overall sweet, nice texture but could be harder (A-tier) 

Crimson crisp - nothing special, very good texture solid apple flavor
